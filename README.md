# Weather App
Created using OpenWeatherMap's free API to update in real time. I hope to add to this project and I have a few ideas. Of course I would like to add more detail and more design to make it more useful. I'd also like to add an API to automatically update the location to that of the user's as right now it is set to just West Lafayette, Indiana.
