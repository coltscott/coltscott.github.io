# Weather App
Created using OpenWeatherMap's free API to update in real time. I hope to add to this project and I have a few ideas. Of course I would like to add more detail and more design to make it more useful. For now, the site is useful for displaying current weather information by searching a city within the search box. Includes limited support for mobile and works on desktop.
